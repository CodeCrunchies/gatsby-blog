> **Disclaimer:** The purpose of this post is not to teach you React (not that I believe a single blog post can actually teach you React) but to help you teach yourself React.

It can be difficult to learn something from scratch as a beginner. You might get lost among the sea of resources available on the web as it can get confusing to know where to start?

I have compiled a list of free resources that have helped me learn React as well as get better at it throughout the years.

This list will be helpful for those who already have a knowledge of programming fundamentals as well as knowledge of JavaScript, HTML and CSS and wish to start learning React.



## Where to start?

### If you like watching video tutorials

If your learning style involves watching videos while you code along with them, the best place to start would be a YouTube tutorial playlist/course or enrolling in a course (free or paid) on platforms such as Udemy, Coursera, or Udacity.

Some of my recommendations are â€”

* [Full React Course 2020 - Learn Fundamentals, Hooks, Context API, React Router, Custom Hooks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4UZrsTqkcW4)
* [Learn React JS - Full Course for Beginners - Tutorial 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLX62G4lc44)


The [Learn React](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/react-101) course on Codecademy helps you develop a strong understanding of the fundamental concepts of React using code-along interactive lessons. It is free, but if you wish to earn a certificate, you can pay for the Pro plan.



## Tutorials can help but they are not enough

Tutorials will help you get a basic understanding of how React applications are structured, what the different building blocks are, and developing an understanding of the essential concepts.

But when you are building real-life applications, you might not have someone to guide you along while you write each and every line of code, that is why building personal projects is a very important part of the learning process.

### Building a Project

The next step from here should be building a small React Application using the concepts you remember from before.

At this point, I will suggest referring to the official [React documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html) and solidifying your fundamentals. The React documentation is incredibly rich and has guides for beginner through advanced concepts.

Some ideas for personal projects can be â€”

* Personal portfolio
* An online store
* Productivity App


## Diving further

Now that you have a pretty good idea of how React works, it's time to learn the best practices of writing React Code and understand the whole React ecosystem better â€”

* React Router
* State Management
* Webpack
* Server Side Rendering
* Unit Testing
* and much more.

### Contributing to Open Source

The best way to learn from more experienced people than you, if you don't have a job yet or if don't use React at your workplace, would be to contribute to open source projects.

You can pick a component library of your choice from [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=react) and start solving the existing bugs/issues on GitHub.

Or you can even look for a [project on GitHub](https://github.com/topics/react) that uses React and start contributing to it. A lot of open source projects have beginner-friendly issues labeled so that would be a good place to begin!



## Where to go from here?

* Read Dan Abramov's blog â€” [Overreacted](https://overreacted.io/)
* Read the [Advance React Guides](https://reactjs.org/docs/accessibility.html)
* Attend/Watch talks in [React Conferences](https://reactjs.org/community/conferences.html)
* And of course - keep learning! ðŸ¤“
